This is my COMP5347 A1. 
Author: Ethan Hirschowitz

1. Apologies

* Sorry for not implementing the previous comparisons section, for not completing the filters section, and for submitting slightly late 

* I had some personal things come up which took some time away from me, however I am not sure if it is grounds for special consideration. I did really enjoy this project and wish I could have spent more time on it.

2. This webapp was developed on Firefox, but should run fine on all browsers.

* The paths are all relative, and thus running the website should be fairly simple

* To run the website: cd to the project directory, then run "http-server"

* Opening the generated link should allow you to view & interact with the webpage
