This is my COMP5347 A1. 
Author: Ethan Hirschowitz

1. Apologies

* Sorry for not implementing the previous comparisons section, for not completing the filters section, and for submitting slightly late 

* I had some personal things come up however I am not sure if it is grounds for special consideration, but I did enjoy this project and wish I could have spent more time on it

2. This webapp was developed on Firefox, but should run fine on all browsers.

* The paths are all relative, and thus running the website should be fairly simple

* Cd to the project directory and run "https-server"

* Opening the given link should be enough to view the webpage
